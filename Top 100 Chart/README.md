# Top 100 Chart Project

This project is a snapshot of the use of Excel skills in one of my hobbies, being music and mainstream songs in general. These track the popularity of songs in a weekly basis throughout the year, as well as using the weekly results to calculate year-end popularity of every song in 2024.

This project contains the 2 following excel spreadsheets.

## Top 100 Chart.xlsx

This Microsoft Excel file contains the top 100 songs of every week in the year 2024. In a technical standpoint, this file demonstrates my skills in Excel in SPSS calculations such as VLOOKUP and IF functions and conditional rules on cell colors. The spreadsheet is also built in a way that its format can be adapted to external power querying into other excel spreadsheets or Power BI environments.

## Year Points.xlsx

This Microsoft Excel file takes data from the Top 100 Chart.xlsx spreadsheet, assign points to each song every week based on how well they perform in the weekly charts, and add the points up throughout the year, creating a table of the overall popularity of the songs in 2024 based on the assigned points. This file demonstrates my ability to extract data from another spreadsheet and incorporating a reference table to create a new database from another database, all using Excelâ€™s built-in Power Query
