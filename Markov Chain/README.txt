# Markov Chains - Hypothesis Testing

This folder contains R-Code and PDF of one of my statistics projects in school. It is a theoretical dive on hypothesis testing test statistic and methodologies on multiple Markov chains. They contain data simulations and analysis on why a certain way of hypothesis testing works in this particular case of Markov chains.

R-Code is in the form of a Markdown, and PDF is in a form of a short scientific journal.
